    <P>The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Katha which means "story", and Kathakar which means "the one who tells a story", or "to do with stories". Wandering Kathakars communicated stories from the great epics and ancient mythology through dance, songs and music. Kathak dancers tell various stories through their hand movements and extensive footwork, their body movements and flexibility but most importantly through their facial expressions. Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms.</P>

    <p>Kathakali is a classical dance form of Kerala, demanding long years of training. Believed to have evolved from Ramanattam, another classical art form composed by Kottarakkara Thampuran, Kathakali incorporates the techniques of some of the major ritual art forms of Kerala. The characters of Kathakali do not speak and the story is presented through songs from the background. This makes Kathakali music a very important component of this art form. The text of Kathakali songs is known as Attakkatha. Chenda, Maddalam, Chengila and Elaththalam are the instruments used with Kathakali music.</p>
    <h2>LAVANI (MAHARASHTRA)</h2>

    <p>Bihu is a set of three important cultural festivals unique to the Indian state of Assam : 'Rongali' or 'Bohag Bihu' observed in April, 'Kongali' or 'Kati Bihu' observed in October or November, and 'Bhogali' or 'Magh Bihu' observed in January.The festivals present an admixture of Tibeto-Burman, Austroasiatic and Indo-Aryan traditions entwined so intricately that it is impossible to separate them ,festivals which are uniquely Assamese to which all communities of Assam had contributed elements.The Rongali Bihu is the most important of the three, celebrating spring festival. The Bhogali Bihu or the Magh Bihu is a harvest festival, with community feasts. The Kongali Bihu or the Kati Bihu is the sombre, thrifty one reflecting a season of short supplies and is an animistic festival.</p>
